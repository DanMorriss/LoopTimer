# LoopTimer features

What the app does, one file per feature, written so it could be rebuilt on another platform (an iPhone app, say) without reading the Angular code.

Each file has the same sections:

- **Stories**: who wants what, and why, each with a stable ID (e.g. `ALM-2`) to refer to from TODO.md, PRs and issues.
- **Rules**: exact behaviour, limits and wording. These are what a port gets subtly wrong.
- **Acceptance criteria**: Given / When / Then checks. Most are taken from the web app's tests.
- **Platform notes**: how the web app does it and what an iPhone app would need. Everything above this section is meant to hold on any platform.

## Stories

Status: ✅ done, ◐ partly, — not started. The iOS column fills in as a port happens.

What's saved on the device, and in what shape, is in [data](data.md). Where the app is heading, and why the planned stories are in the order they are, is in [direction](../direction.md).

### The original stories

The README's first five user stories map onto these: 1 → BLD-1, 2 → BLD-2, 3 → BLD-3 and ALM-1 (ALM-4 to come), 4 → ALM-2, 5 → LIB-1.

## Keeping these up to date

A change in behaviour updates its file here in the same PR: the rule, an acceptance criterion if there's a new test for it, and the status above. A new feature gets a new story ID; IDs are never reused or renumbered.
