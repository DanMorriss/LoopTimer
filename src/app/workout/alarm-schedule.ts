 * The alarms in a workout, in order: the start of each step, then the finish. Uses the
 * same timings as `workoutStateAt()`, so they line up with the countdown. Rest at the end of
 * the last round has no alarm.
 *
 * A rep step sounds the work alarm as it starts. Nothing after it can be booked, as no one
 * knows when it will be done, so the list stops there; after Done (`repStepsDone` one
 * higher, and `startedAt` moved on) it carries on from the next step. Rep steps already
 * done have no alarm.
 *
 * A workout that runs until stopped has no end, so only the `roundCount` rounds starting
 * at round `fromRound` (counting from 0) are listed; finite workouts stop at their last round.
 *
 * With a time limit, steps stop where time runs out, with a countdown beep before it
 * (`TIME_LIMIT_COUNTDOWN`) and the finish as it does. That moment is known even while a rep
 * step is waited on: `startedAt` plus the limit, less `repMs`, the time on rep steps already
 * done, as Done moves `startedAt` on by just what it adds to `repMs`.
