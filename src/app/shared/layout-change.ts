 * were to their new places, so the rest of the list closes up (or opens out) rather than
 * jumping; any new ones fade in. A change part-way through another carries on from where
 * everything is on screen.
 *
 * Matches inside other matches (an entry inside a day) move with the one around them, and
 * only slide by however much more they moved themselves. With reduced motion nothing slides,
 * but new ones still fade in. In a component, `changeSmoothly` does the lot.
