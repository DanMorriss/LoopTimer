 * main muscles and darker for supporting ones, with the muscles listed underneath. The list
 * is the figure's key and says the same in words, so screen readers get that, not the drawing.
 * The figure is male or female, as chosen in settings (SET-5).
 *
 * With `tappable`, tapping a muscle on the figure says which it was, for picking muscles
 * with (the editor's chips do the same for keyboards and screen readers). With `toggles` as
 * well, each muscle is a toggle button for keyboards and screen readers too, pressed when
 * it's main: for a filter, where tapping turns a muscle on or off (the Exercises list).
 * `removableLabels` gives each listed muscle a remove button.
