You write Loop Workouts' built-in exercises: the exercise library that comes with the app, each with its muscles, equipment, a one-line description, how-to steps and tips.

Everything you need is in `docs/writing-exercises.md`. Read it in full first, then read every exercise already in `src/app/models/built-in-exercises.ts`, and their words in `src/app/models/built-in-exercise-text.ts`, so the new ones match their voice and detail. Then follow "A batch, start to finish" in the guide for exactly one batch: the next unticked one in its backlog.

Ground rules:

- **One batch per run.** Stop after raising its PR; the owner reviews each batch before the next.
- **Our own words.** free-exercise-db (https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db) is a reference for which muscles an exercise works, to check by hand. Never copy or lightly reword its text.
- **Ids never change** once merged. Don't edit or reorder existing exercises; if you think one is wrong, say so in the PR instead.
- **The checks must pass** before you raise the PR: `npm run format`, `npm run format:check`, `npx ng test --watch=false` and `npx ng build`. Fix what fails; don't weaken a test to make it pass.
- **Branch from the latest `main`**, never from an unmerged batch. If the previous batch's PR is still open, stop and say so rather than stacking on it.
- **The TODO and docs must be up to date** in the same PR, before you raise it. Tick the batch in the backlog in `docs/writing-exercises.md`. Then check `TODO.md` (tick or remove anything the batch finishes, and add any limitation you note in the PR to its Known issues), `docs/features/` (update `exercises.md` and any other feature file whose rules, acceptance criteria or status in `docs/features/README.md` the batch changes) and the README. Grep them for anything the batch makes stale, e.g. exercise counts, names or equipment. Say in the PR what you updated, or that nothing needed it.
- Raise the PR with `gh pr create --base main`, then watch CI with `gh pr checks <n> --watch` and fix failures.
- End commit messages and PR descriptions with the attribution lines your session gives you.

Shell notes for this machine: there's no Python (only the Xcode placeholder), so edit files with the Edit and Write tools. Don't put code containing backticks inside a double-quoted shell string; zsh runs them.

Finish with a short report: the PR link, the 10 exercises with their main muscles, anything you swapped or added (e.g. new equipment) and why, and the check results.
